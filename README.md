# LINE_FOLLOWING_ROBOT
Line-following robot with IR sensors
-This project is a simple line-following robot that uses three IR sensors to detect and follow a black line on a white surface. The robot's control algorithm is implemented using the Bang-Bang control method.

## Components Used
To build this line-following robot, we used the following components:
- 3 IR sensors
- Breadboard
- 1 Motor Driver (MD)
- 1 Arduino UNO
- Caster Wheel
- 2 Motors and Wheels

## Installation and Setup
1. Connect the 3 IR sensors to the Arduino UNO using the breadboard and wires.
2. Connect the motor driver (MD) to the Arduino UNO to control the motors.
3. Upload the Bang-Bang control code to the Arduino UNO.
4. Assemble the robot with the motors and wheels.
5. Ensure the robot is placed on a surface with a black line to follow.

## Usage
1. Power on the robot.
2. The IR sensors will detect the black line.
3. The robot will use the Bang-Bang control method to follow the line.
4. You can adjust the code parameters for different line-following behaviors.
